The code has two main entry points, the scripts main_formation_forming.m and main_dist_rejection_platooning.m, both in the root directory of this repository.
They will produce the material presented in the paper.

In order to run the code, the following Matlab packages are required:
- CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/)

The code has been tested using:
- Matlab R2017b
- CVX version 2.1
